    "Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic unicellular prokaryotic organisms that have been present on earth for the last 2.5 billion years (Brocks, 1999). Cyanobacteria are considered the firs oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms contributing to oxygen production on Earth (Rasmussen, 2008). They can grow as individual cells, filamentus or colonies, creating big blooms that are visible (Catherine, 2013). \n",

    "Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 is one of the most studied cyanobacteria species, and it was first isolated from a lake in 1968 (Yu, 2013). Its genome size is 3.6 Mb, and it can be easily engineered. The genome of Synechocystis PCC6803 was sequenced by Kaneko et al. (1996), and it was the first genomic sequence obtained from a photosynthetic autotroph microorganism. Synechocystis PCC6803 can either use the Calvin cycle to fix CO2 as a photoautotrophic or use glycolysis to metabolize glucose as heterotrophic. It can also show a photoheterotrophic metabolism. However, cellular growth is around 8-fold higher in photoautotrophic (7-10 hours) than in heterotrophic metabolism (84 hours) (Yu, 2013).  Genetic modification studies shown that Synechocystis PCC6803 has a very plastic metabolism, being able to adapt from photoautotrophic to heterotrophic growing conditions (Vermaas, 1996). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cyanobacteria are very good potential cell factory platform because of its fast growth rate, the sustainable process when fixing CO2 and the easily engineered genome. There are also some challenges that must be solved in the future, such as low product titer, long biosynthesis process or production and scale-up costs (Yu, 2013). Cyanobacteria have been used for production of several biofuels such as ethanol, butanol or isobutanol (Nozzi, 2013); pharmaceutical bioactive compounds (Vijayakumar, 2015) and other chemical compound as polyketides, terpenes, alkaloids (Gademann, 2011). \n",
    "\n",
    "Different genome-scale metabolic models have addressed Synechocystis PCC6803. First genome-scale network was characterized by Shastri & Morgan (2005) using a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). In order to improve the multiple solutions obtained with this first stoichiometric-based FBA model, other methods were used. Flux Coupling Finder (FCF) was used, in combination with transcriptomics, to elucidate the metabolic modifications that lead to change from autotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism as a respond to availability of light (Montagud, 2011). Recently, FBA has been used to build a new genomic-scale model with a better characterization of the photo-respiratory metabolism. Moreover, this model used Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (DFBA) to consider the metabolic changes due to light-dark cycle (Joshi, 2017).  \n"

    "Results show that biomass growth is decreased to a very low levels, what can be explained as a result of tyrosine production inhibition because tyrosine is considered by the model to calculate the BIOMASS flux. Regarding the p-coumaric production, it also decreases to values much more lower compared to wild-type. The study carried out by Gao et al. (2021) revealed an increase of 54% in p-coumaric production when tyrosine pathway was knocked out. Thus, our model don't predict the *in-vitro* results and further optimization regarding other knock out targets should be done. "

    "\n",
    "Another option to increase p-coumaric production would be to clone the gen encoding an enzyme able to directly convert L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid in a sinlge reaction step. We select the enzyme XAL from *Trichosporon cutaneum*, which was already cloned and studied in *Synechocystis* sp. PCC6303 by Brel et al. (2020). XAL has both phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) activity. Ideally, we clone the enzyme with a high constitutive expression system, which would redirect close to 100% tyrosine to p-coumaric conversion. Tyrosine and subproducts could be exogenously administered to ensure metabolic flux through the tyrosine related essential pathways. "
